## Project Title
###Bikeshare Project - Improve Documentation

### Description
In the context of the Udacity Nanodegree I needed to evaluate and analyze different data regarding the use of bikesharing in three different US-cities. However, the documentation still lacks in clearity and comprehensibility. This project aims to fix this.

### Files used
